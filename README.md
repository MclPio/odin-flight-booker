[Link](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker)

The goal of this project is to work with advanced forms, by building three steps of an airline's checkout process.

1. Selecting dates and airports to search
2. Choosing a flight
3. Entering passenger information

## Set up

- $ ```git clone git@github.com:MclPio/odin-flight-booker.git```
- $ ```bundle install```
- $ ```./bin/rails css:install:bulma```
- $ ```bundle exec figaro install```
- Set up gmail user and password in ```config/application.yml``` generated by figaro (optional), can use letter_opener instead if you do not want email integration.
  - ```gmail_username: "<gmail username>"```
  - ```gmail_password: "<app password>"```
- start app with $ ```./bin/dev```
