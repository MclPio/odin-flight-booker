nice to have:
1. make a task that auto installs css bundler and bulma for new clones

needed:
1. flights/index.html.erb needs to have label fixed.
2. style the rest of the application view and email with bulma.
3. register a new gmail account for mailer and deploy.
4. Need to seed database when deploying.
